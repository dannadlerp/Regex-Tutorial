# Title Regex Tutorial

As a University of Toronto Bootcamp student, I am learning about Regular Expressions (regex). This tutorial will help breakdown one such Regex and define it so we can better learn how it functions.

## Summary

A Regular Expression is a sequence that picks out match patterns in text. Often used by string-searching algorithyms to find or find and replace operations to validate user input.

Below is a Regex that scans a string and validated whether or not it is in the format of an email address:

`^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors defines the position of the pattern in the input string.

- `^` defines the beginning of the string
- `$` defines the end of the string

Using both ensures the string matches the pattern.
